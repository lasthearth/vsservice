# Security Requirements Quality Checklist: News Deletion with Scope Authorization

**Purpose**: Unit tests for requirements quality in news deletion feature
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Focus**: Security and authorization requirements for news deletion by ID

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all necessary authentication requirements specified for the DeleteNews endpoint? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]

- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements for handling unauthenticated users explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are all error response requirements documented for different failure scenarios? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are requirements for concurrent deletion attempts fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are all security-related edge cases addressed in requirements? [Completeness, Edge Case]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 - Is 'news:delete scope' quantified with specific definition of what it enables? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is 'gRPC error format' defined with specific structure and message types? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the maximum allowed response time for deletion quantified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-TBD]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are the terms 'proper authorization' and 'valid authentication' clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 - Do authentication requirements align between user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are authorization patterns consistent with existing settlement service patterns? [Consistency, Plan]
- [ ] CHK013 - Do error response requirements match established gRPC patterns in the project? [Consistency, Constitution]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 - Can 'proper authorization' be objectively verified against defined scope requirements? [Measurability, Spec §US2]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are success metrics for deletion operation measurable and testable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK016 - Can 'unauthorized access' blocking be quantified at 100% as specified? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK026 - Are security requirements aligned with compliance obligations? [NFR]
- [ ] CHK027 - Are requirements defined for system resilience during deletion operations? [NFR, Plan]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK028 - Are dependencies on JWT authentication system documented in requirements? [Dependency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK029 - Are dependencies on Scoper interface validated in requirements? [Dependency, Plan]
- [ ] CHK030 - Is the assumption about associated data integrity validated? [Assumption, Spec §FR-008]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK031 - Is the term 'associated data' clearly defined in the requirements? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK032 - Are there any conflicts between performance requirements and security validation? [Conflict, NFR]
