# Research Summary: News View Counter

## Overview
This document outlines the research and decisions made for implementing the news view counter feature based on the feature specification.

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Use MongoDB's atomic increment operation for view counts
**Rationale:** Using MongoDB's atomic increment (e.g., `$inc` operator) ensures thread safety when multiple users view the same article simultaneously. This is crucial for preventing race conditions where multiple requests try to increment the same view count at once.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Application-level locking: Would create performance bottlenecks
- Separate increment service: Would add complexity without significant benefits

### Decision: Store view count as a field in the news article document
**Rationale:** Storing the view count directly in the news article document provides good read performance since the count is available with the article data in a single query. This approach aligns with the document-oriented nature of MongoDB.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Separate view count collection: Would require joins/lookups, impacting performance
- Redis counter with periodic sync: Would add infrastructure complexity for minimal benefit

### Decision: Increment count on article view request (not on page load)
**Rationale:** Incrementing on the server-side request (when the article data is fetched) ensures more accurate counting and prevents artificial inflation from client-side reloads or bots that don't execute JavaScript.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Client-side counting: Would be vulnerable to artificial inflation
- Event-based counting: Would add complexity with event queues

## Performance Considerations

### Concurrent Access Handling
For handling up to 100 concurrent users viewing news articles, MongoDB's atomic operations will ensure data consistency without requiring application-level locks.

### Scale Limitations
With up to 1,000 articles and 50 views/day per article, the expected load is relatively light. The design should handle this without performance issues.

## Implementation Approach

### gRPC Service Extension
The news view counter functionality will be implemented by extending the existing news service with:
- A method to increment view count when an article is viewed
- A method to retrieve article with current view count
- Proper error handling for increment failures

### Data Model Changes
- Add `view_count` field to the News model
- Initialize with default value of 0
- Ensure atomic increment operation in repository layer

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: High-frequency updates to popular articles
**Mitigation:** While not required per clarifications, the atomic operations in MongoDB will handle concurrent updates safely. For future scaling, consider eventual consistency updates or separate read/write models.

### Risk: System failure during increment
**Mitigation:** Implement appropriate error handling and logging. Since view counts are not critical business data, a failed increment would result in an undercount rather than system failure.
