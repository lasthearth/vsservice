# Feature Specification: News View Counter

**Feature Branch**: `004-feat-news-view`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat-news-view-counter: Мне нужно добавить счетчик просмотров для каждой отдельной новости, при каждом просмотре просто инкрементировать его на 1"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - News View Counter Display (Priority: P1)

As a user, when I view a news article, I want to see how many times this article has been viewed by other users so that I can understand its popularity and relevance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature - displaying the view count to users when they view a news article.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a news article and verifying that the view count is displayed. The feature delivers value by providing users with information about news popularity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to a news article page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the view count for that specific news article is displayed prominently on the page.
2. **Given** a news article exists with an initial view count of 0, **When** a user views the article, **Then** the view count is incremented by 1 and displayed to the user.

### User Story 2 - View Count Increment on News View (Priority: P1)

As a system, when a user views a news article, I need to increment the view counter for that specific news article by exactly 1.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature - accurately tracking and incrementing the view count when articles are viewed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a news article view and verifying that the view count for that article increases by exactly 1. The feature delivers value by providing accurate popularity metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a news article with a current view count of N, **When** a user views the article, **Then** the view count is incremented to N+1.
2. **Given** a user views a news article for the first time, **When** the view is recorded, **Then** the view count is incremented by 1 regardless of the user's previous viewing history.

---

### User Story 3 - View Count Persistence (Priority: P2)

As a system, I need to ensure that news view counts are reliably stored and maintained even when the system restarts or experiences failures.

**Why this priority**: This ensures the integrity and reliability of the view count data, maintaining trust in the displayed metrics.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing system restarts or failure scenarios and verifying that view counts remain accurate and persistent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a news article has accumulated view counts, **When** the system restarts, **Then** the view counts are preserved and remain accurate.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the same user views the same news article multiple times in a short period? (No rate limiting needed per clarifications)
- How does the system handle concurrent views of the same news article by multiple users simultaneously?
- What happens if the system fails during the view count update process?
- What is the maximum possible view count value before potential overflow issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST increment the view counter by exactly 1 each time a news article is viewed
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the current view count for each news article to users
- **FR-003**: System MUST store view count data persistently so counts remain intact across system restarts
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a separate view count for each individual news article
- **FR-005**: System MUST update the view count in a timely manner after a news article is viewed
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT implement rate limiting to prevent potential abuse of the view counter mechanism
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain view count data indefinitely (no specific retention policy)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **News Article**: Represents an individual news item that has a unique identifier and a view count property
- **View Count**: An integer value representing the number of times a specific news article has been viewed

### Assumptions

- The system already has a mechanism for displaying news articles to users
- Users access news articles through a web interface or mobile application
- The underlying news article storage system supports adding new properties
- The system has an existing data persistence layer that can store view count information
- View counting applies to all news articles, including historical articles
- The system handles up to 100 concurrent users viewing news articles
- There are up to 1,000 news articles in the system with up to 50 views per day per article
- No special privacy regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) apply to view count tracking
- No user roles are needed - public access for all users
- No rate limiting is required for view counting

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the view count for any news article within 2 seconds of loading the article page
- **SC-002**: View counts are incremented within 1 second of a news article being viewed
- **SC-003**: 99.9% of view count increments are successfully recorded and persisted
- **SC-004**: View counts remain accurate and available during system maintenance windows

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: Are there different user roles that might have different permissions for viewing or updating news article view counts? → A: No user roles needed, public access for all
- Q: How many concurrent users viewing news articles simultaneously should the system be designed to handle? → A: Up to 100 concurrent users
- Q: Are there any privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA) or compliance requirements that apply to tracking view counts? → A: No special privacy/compliance requirements
- Q: Approximately how many news articles are expected to be in the system, and what's the expected daily view volume per article? → A: Small scale: up to 1,000 articles with up to 50 views/day per article
- Q: Should the system implement rate limiting to prevent potential abuse of the view counter mechanism? → A: No, no rate limiting needed
