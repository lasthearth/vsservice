# Feature Specification: Nickname Change with Admin Notification

**Feature Branch**: `005-feat-nickname-change`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat-nickname-change: Как пользователь хочу Возможность сменить игровой ник, При смене игрового ника - отправлять администратору уведомление, что игрок такой то сменил ник на такой то, Кул даун раз в 6 реальных месяцев"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Change Nickname (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to be able to change my gaming nickname so that I can personalize my profile and have control over my identity in the game.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that directly addresses the user's primary need to change their nickname.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a player, navigating to profile settings, changing the nickname, and verifying that the change is saved and reflected across the system within the cooldown constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player has a valid account with an existing nickname, **When** player requests a nickname change after cooldown period has passed, **Then** the system allows the change and updates the player's nickname
2. **Given** player has already changed their nickname less than 6 months ago, **When** player requests another nickname change, **Then** the system rejects the request and informs the player about the cooldown period

---

### User Story 2 - Admin Notification (Priority: P2)

As an admin, I want to be notified when a player changes their nickname so that I can monitor player activity and track identity changes for security and moderation purposes.

**Why this priority**: This provides visibility to the admin team and helps maintain system integrity, but is secondary to the core nickname change functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by changing a player's nickname and verifying that an appropriate notification is sent to the admin team with the required information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player successfully changes their nickname, **When** the nickname change is processed, **Then** the system sends a notification to administrators containing the player's old nickname, new nickname, and timestamp

---

### User Story 3 - Cooldown Enforcement (Priority: P3)

As a game operator, I want to enforce a cooldown period between nickname changes to prevent abuse and maintain stability of player identities.

**Why this priority**: This is important for system governance and preventing potential abuse, but is a constraint on the primary functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to change a nickname multiple times within the 6-month period and verifying the cooldown is enforced correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player has recently changed their nickname, **When** they attempt another change within 6 months of the last change, **Then** the system rejects the request and informs the player when they can next change their nickname

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player tries to change to a nickname that is already taken by another player?
- How does system handle special characters, profanity, or inappropriate content in the new nickname?
- What if the notification system fails when sending admin notifications?
- How does the system handle players who created accounts within the last 6 months and want their first nickname change?
- What happens if a player's account is suspended or banned during the cooldown period?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: For the admin notification functionality, what is the preferred method for delivering notifications to administrators? → A: get a list of users with the admin role from logto and use the internal notification mechanism in the system to send a notification to all admins
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of concurrent nickname change requests the system should handle during peak usage? → A: 10
- Q: Regarding the validation of new nicknames, what specific validation rules should be applied to ensure appropriate content? → A: Character limit of 15 characters with alphanumeric characters and special characters allowed
- Q: What should happen if the system fails to send a notification to administrators when a nickname change occurs? → A: Log the failure but don't retry
- Q: Should the system maintain a public record of nickname changes that other players can view, or should this information be private and only accessible to administrators? → A: Store previous nickname but only one, not full history, visible to everyone
