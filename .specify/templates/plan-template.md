# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
  
  CRITICAL NOTE FOR EXISTING CODEBASES: Before planning any new feature, analyze the
  existing codebase to understand:
  - Current architectural patterns and conventions
  - Domain boundaries and service responsibilities
  - Data models and repository patterns
  - API design patterns and protobuf definitions
  - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
  - Error handling and logging patterns
  - Dependency injection with Uber fx
  - Testing strategies and patterns
  
  Incorporate these existing patterns in your plan to ensure consistency.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Existing Codebase Analysis

**Current Architecture Patterns**:
- [Identify main architectural patterns: e.g., microservices, layered architecture, DDD]
- [Service structure: e.g., each feature as separate service with fx dependency injection]
- [API patterns: e.g., gRPC with grpc-gateway for REST, protobuf definitions]
- [Data layer: e.g., models, DTOs, repository pattern, MongoDB usage]
- [Authentication: e.g., JWT-based with interceptors, scope-based authorization]

**Integration Points**:
- [Identify where new feature will integrate: specific services, models, repositories]
- [API endpoints that may need extension or modification]
- [Database collections that will be affected]

**Existing Patterns to Follow**:
- [List specific patterns from the codebase that new implementation should follow]
- [Naming conventions, error handling, logging patterns]
- [Dependency injection patterns, service registration]
- [Validation and security patterns]

**Potential Conflicts**:
- [Identify any existing code that might conflict with new feature]
- [Domain boundaries that might be affected]
- [Shared resources that might need coordination]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
